# **Prime Number Checker**

This project is a simple command-line tool written in Python to check if a given number is prime. It was developed as a personal learning exercise to explore different algorithms and optimization techniques for prime number checking.

## **Features**

* **Efficient Primality Test**: The is\_prime function implements an optimized algorithm that checks for divisibility by 2 and 3, and then uses a loop to check only odd numbers up to the square root of the input number.  
* **User-Friendly Interface**: The program prompts the user to enter a positive integer and provides clear output.  
* **Error Handling**: It includes a try-except block to gracefully handle non-integer inputs.  
* **Continuous Input**: The program continues to run until the user enters \-1 to exit.

## **How to Run**

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.  
2. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., prime\_checker.py).  
3. Run the file from your terminal:  
   python prime\_checker.py

## **Learning Experience**

This project was a great opportunity to practice.

The commented-out code within the file serves as a record of earlier, less optimal attempts, which is a key part of the learning journey. It demonstrates the process of refining an algorithm from a basic idea to a more efficient solution.
